# norwegianpaws_patch
A fix so it is more viable on mobile

To test it:
- open index.css and copy it (button on the line above)
- install a css overwrite extension and config it


I used [Simple CSS inserter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/simple-css-inserter/)
- paste the CSS into it and save
- select inclusions
- type in norwegianpaws.org

It should now work
